    1: A portion of fees from transactions go to the insurance fund
    2: Sometimes, the insurance fund is used to cover shortfall and bad debt that users accrue, to make all creditors whole
    3: The insurance fund has the power to shut all the vAMMs down, in the case of an emergency
    
    4 + 5: Like  the insurance fund, a portion of fees from transactions in the engine go to the fee pool, and are then distributed to token holders
    
    6: The vAMM calculates the input and output prices when swapping and the Engine uses these to calculate position size
    7: The positional data that the vAMM returns is then stored in the Engine. Most of the data is user input, but the vAMM calculates the position size
    8: The vAMM calculates the funding payments, and to do so it receives pricing data from the on-chain oracle, which is implemented via the Pricefeed contract
